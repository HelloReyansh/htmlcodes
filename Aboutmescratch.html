	<p>	Hi! I am Naturecars. I made this because I ran out of words twice in my real scratch section,
		and it was easier for me to make a site instead!
	<br/>
		By the way, this was fully made with html.
	<br/>
	<h3>This is the real about me section(hehehe):)</h3>
	<br/>
		I am a 12 years old boy.I love to read storybooks, draw but
		my most favorite hobby is to do scratch !(and html and Minecraft)
		My sister also does scratch.Check her out as she makes <i>Strange</i>
		projects.Her name is @Swwety.
		My Blog is - <a href="https://royalrenolds.blogspot.com/">Royal Reynold Blogs</a>
